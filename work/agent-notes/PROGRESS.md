# Baseline step-count progress

## 2026-10-16: setup and source inspection

- Branch: `agent/baseline-steps`; initial checkout clean, based on `main`.
- Read AGENTS.md, CHALLENGE, SUBMISSIONS, TESTING, EEST-SPIKE,
  ALLOC-AUDIT, JOURNAL-BOUND, ENVELOPE and arena-bound.py. Did not read CLAUDE.md.
- Initial resource observation: 16 CPUs, 30 GiB RAM (26 GiB available),
  31 GiB swap, filesystem 39% used / 176 GiB available. Host is aarch64.
- Lean 4.33.1 installed. Dependencies, binutils, Spike, ELF and fixtures absent.
  Local search including hidden caches found no substitutes. No baseline run yet.
- User subsequently authorized installation: “install what you need”. Started
  apt prerequisites, pinned Spike checkout / fixture download, and compiler build
  with LAKE_ARTIFACT_CACHE=false and the two-slot limiter. Logs under `logs/`.
- Full verifier and full audit are prohibited and have not been run.
- Source finding: htab_hash XOR-folds keys, permitting constructed collisions;
  linear probing needs a worst-case bound rather than expected constant cost.
- Source finding: bootstrap ASM trace length is 23,120, whereas documented
  hardware count is 23,127. The checked evaluator theorem currently existentially
  quantifies count. These are different quantities.
- Source finding: ALLOC-AUDIT and JOURNAL-BOUND contain stale layout and trap
  classification claims. Current Observations excludes trap lengths 1,6,7 only;
  lengths 4 and 5 remain covered. Current memory contract has 29 GiB RAM.

## Open proof obligations

No new `sorry` introduced. Existing submission still claims infinity.
Outstanding: measurements, pass cost bounds, source gas/input clock bound,
composition below the Yukon numeric limit, finite certificate and axiom checks.
No isolated verification or finite-score success is claimed.

## First checked pilot and fixture preparation

- All 33,614 fixture inputs converted successfully with no selection cap.
- `ClockBounds` built with the pinned Lean and limited Lake (one slot alongside
  two compiler-build slots; observed total used RAM below 6 GiB). Build: 2.50 s,
  maximum child RSS 827,812 KiB (`clock-bounds.time`). Initial attempt failed
  because `prefix` is a Lean keyword; renamed to `prefixCost`. No sorry used.
- `prefix_within` and `transport_within` have no axioms;
  `finite_family_bound` uses only propext and Quot.sound. This is a bookkeeping
  pilot, not a quantitative compiler theorem or finite certificate.
- Added step/gas report tool; six framing/offset/count tests pass. Gas used is
  explicitly marked as the payload claim, not measured EVM execution gas.
- Generated 16 synthetic full-guest inputs, including malformed blobs up to
  the arena boundary and zero-user-gas witness/withdrawal workloads. Not run yet.
- Added TargetClock pilot for actual evaluator terminal dispatch and bounded
  prefixes; build pending. No open sorry, but not yet typechecked.
- Initial commit needed a Git author identity. Local commits use explicit
  `Codex <codex@localhost>` command-local settings; global config unchanged.
- gh fixture download failed for lack of authentication. Public HTTPS curl
  fetched the same release asset (591 MiB), then extraction/conversion succeeded.
